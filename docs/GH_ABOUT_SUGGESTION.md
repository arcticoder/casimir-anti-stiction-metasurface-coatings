Short description (one line): Research-stage metasurface coatings exploring Casimir-Lifshitz interactions for stiction reduction; see docs/ for validation artifacts.

Long description (for GitHub About): This repository contains research code, models, and prototype documentation investigating metasurface coatings and engineered Casimir-Lifshitz interactions aimed at reducing stiction in precision devices. Results are preliminary and derived from simulation and limited prototype tests; they are not production-ready. See `docs/benchmarks.md` and `docs/UQ-notes.md` for reproduction instructions, uncertainty quantification details, and raw artifacts. When publishing summaries, link to validation artifacts and avoid absolutist language.
