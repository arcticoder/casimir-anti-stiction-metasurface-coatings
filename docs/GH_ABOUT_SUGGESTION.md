Short suggestion (for GitHub About):
Casimir anti-stiction metasurface coatings — research-stage demonstrations and modelling for reducing microscale adhesion. See docs/ for validation and UQ artifacts.

Long suggestion (expanded description):
This repository contains research-stage demonstrations, models, and experimental reports exploring engineered metasurface coatings that reduce stiction in micro- and nanoscale contacts. Reported results are specific to the documented test configurations and are intended to support reproducibility, independent validation, and responsible communication. Before using any numbers in public summaries, link to the corresponding validation artifacts under `docs/` (for example, `docs/benchmarks.md` and `docs/UQ-notes.md`) and indicate the experimental or simulated conditions.

Recommended short badges / phrasing to include in the GitHub About box:
- "Research-stage — validation and UQ available in `docs/`"
- "Not production-ready — see `docs/Scope_Validation_Limitations.md` for limits"

Notes for maintainers:
- If you publish repository summaries (e.g., README or release notes) include links to the validation scripts and raw artifacts used for reported figures.
- If you want, I can open a PR updating the repository description and README summary with conservative wording and links to the specific docs/ pages.
