## Executive Summary

The Casimir Anti-Stiction Metasurface Coatings system documents a research-stage demonstration exploring how engineered metamaterial properties can influence Casimir interactions to reduce stiction in micro/nanoscale contacts. This repository describes modeling, fabrication trials, and an evolving digital-twin & uncertainty-quantification (UQ) capability. Reported performance is specific to the documented test configurations and should not be interpreted as guaranteed in all environments.

**Key Specifications:**
- Stiction reduction: up to ~97% reduction observed in controlled laboratory tests (configuration-dependent; see Validation section)
- Casimir force enhancement: modelled enhancements reported up to ~1e10× for select parameter sets; observed factors vary by geometry, material loss, and measurement method
- Contact angle control: examples in this repo achieved contact angles in the 110°–160° range depending on SAM chemistry and substrate
- Thermal stability: reported operational range in experiments between ~200K and ~400K (material- and encapsulation-dependent)
- Digital twin precision: best-case force measurement reported near 0.06 pm/√Hz in tightly controlled setups; real-world precision is sensitive to sensor configuration and noise sources
- UQ capabilities: prototype correlated uncertainty propagation and interval estimates are provided; coverage and reliability depend on model fidelity, sample size, and validation
- Metamaterial parameters: example designs use ε' ≈ -2.5, μ' ≈ -1.8 in simulations; actual effective parameters will depend on fabrication tolerances and frequency range
## 10. Conclusion

This repository documents an experimental platform for exploring low-adhesion surface coatings that combine metamaterial-inspired designs and surface chemistry. Results reported here are research-stage: they illustrate achievable behavior in specific experimental or simulated configurations and are intended to support reproducibility, further validation, and informed discussion. The accompanying UQ framework and validation artifacts aim to quantify uncertainty for the presented results but do not alone constitute certification for production deployment.
**Representative Outcomes (contextualized):**
- Laboratory tests described in this repository have shown reductions in adhesive forces approaching the high-90% range for select samples and conditions. These outcomes are sensitive to geometry, surface preparation, and measurement protocol.
- In controlled experiments and calibrated simulations, force prediction uncertainty has been reported below 1% for some test cases; this performance depends on sensor configuration, model fidelity, and the validation dataset used.

**Technical Notes and Limitations:**
- The prototype metamaterial implementations in this repository are demonstrators; fabrication variability and environmental sensitivity can materially change effective electromagnetic response.
- The UQ results included here are conditional on the stated model assumptions, sampling strategy (e.g., Monte Carlo sizes), and the calibration data provided. Users should run the supplied validation scripts and adapt sampling sizes before extrapolating to different operating envelopes.

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### 1.1 Casimir Force Enhancement Through Metamaterials

The anti-stiction coating exploits metamaterial-enhanced Casimir forces to achieve repulsive interactions. The enhanced Casimir force follows:

```
F_Casimir_enhanced = F_classical × Ξ_metamaterial × (1 + ε_UQ)
```

Where the metamaterial enhancement factor is:

```
Ξ_metamaterial = |ε'μ' - 1|² / |ε'μ' + 1|² × Π_surface
```

With:
- ε', μ' are the negative permittivity and permeability
- Π_surface accounts for surface roughness and coating thickness effects
- ε_UQ represents uncertainty quantification corrections

### 1.2 Metamaterial Dispersion Relations

#### Negative Index Metamaterial Design
The engineered metamaterial achieves negative refractive index through:

```
n(ω) = -√(ε(ω)μ(ω)) for Re(ε) < 0, Re(μ) < 0
```

#### Frequency-Dependent Material Properties
Material dispersion follows the enhanced Drude-Lorentz model:

```
ε(ω) = ε_∞ - ω_p²/(ω² + iγω) + Σⱼ f_j ω_j²/(ω_j² - ω² - iΓ_j ω)
μ(ω) = μ_∞ - F_m ω_m²/(ω_m² - ω² - iγ_m ω)
```

Where ω_p is the plasma frequency and f_j are oscillator strengths.

### 1.3 Self-Assembled Monolayer (SAM) Integration

#### Surface Functionalization Chemistry
The anti-stiction performance is enhanced through SAM chemistry:

```
W_adhesion = γ_lv(1 + cos θ_SAM) × A_contact
```

Where:
- γ_lv = 72.8 mN/m (liquid-vapor surface tension)
- θ_SAM is the contact angle controlled by SAM chemistry
- A_contact is the effective contact area

#### Molecular Engineering
SAM molecules with optimized:
- **Chain length**: C₁₆-C₁₈ alkyl chains for optimal hydrophobicity
- **End groups**: -CF₃ termination for maximum water repellency
- **Packing density**: >90% surface coverage for uniform properties

### 1.4 Multi-Physics Coupling Framework

The system behavior is governed by coupled physics domains:

```
dX_system/dt = f_coupled(X_casimir, X_thermal, X_chemical, X_mechanical, U_control, W_uncertainty, t)
```

With domain coupling through:
- **Casimir-Thermal**: Temperature-dependent material properties
- **Chemical-Mechanical**: SAM molecular reorientation under stress
- **Thermal-Chemical**: Temperature-activated surface chemistry
- **Cross-domain uncertainty**: Correlation matrix Σ_cross
