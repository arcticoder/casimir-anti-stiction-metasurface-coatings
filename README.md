## Overview

This repository describes research-stage implementations and prototype analyses exploring metasurface coatings that leverage Casimir-Lifshitz interactions to reduce stiction in precision NEMS/MEMS devices. Performance figures shown in this README originate from simulation studies, prototype experiments, and digital-twin runs under specific configurations; they are not guarantees of production performance.

- Reported numbers (stiction reduction, enhancement factors, timing, etc.) depend strongly on fabrication parameters, materials, environmental conditions, and measurement methods. Reproduction instructions, raw outputs, and uncertainty-quantification (UQ) notes are available in `docs/benchmarks.md` and `docs/UQ-notes.md` when present.
- This codebase is intended as a research and prototyping resource. Do not treat the repository as a validated production specification. Any operational use requires independent verification, peer review, formal V&V, and compliance checks.

### Primary Repository Dependencies (reported / integration notes)

1. `warp-bubble-optimizer` — metamaterial enhancement mathematics (UQ and integration work reported; see `docs/` for supporting artifacts)
2. `casimir-nanopositioning-platform` — precision force control and ultra-smooth fabrication (prototype integrations documented)
3. `lqg-anec-framework` — material property specification references

5. `warp-bubble-qft` — supporting metamaterial Casimir documentation
6. `unified-lqg` and `unified-lqg-qft` — material and frequency modeling support

### Reported Validation Notes

- Reported metrics such as energy or enhancement factors come from simulation or prototype test reports; consult the `docs/` directory (e.g., `docs/ENERGY_VALIDATION.md`, `docs/UQ-notes.md`) for provenance, methods, and limitations.
- Where UQ work is claimed in repository text, treat those claims as work-in-progress unless explicit validation artifacts (datasets, scripts, CI results) are linked.
### Scope, Validation & Limitations

- Scope: Prototype designs and simulation studies for metasurface anti-stiction coatings. Not a production specification.
- Validation: Select simulation and prototype results are summarized here; full reproduction instructions and raw data (where available) are in `docs/benchmarks.md` and `docs/UQ-notes.md`.
- Limitations: Reported performance is conditional on high-precision fabrication and controlled test environments. Manufacturing yield, environmental sensitivity, long-term stability, and integration risks remain areas for further study.

If you maintain or extend this repository, please add direct links to any raw data, benchmark scripts, and UQ analyses used to support claims.

## 🎯 Performance Specifications (reported examples; research-stage)

### Anti-Stiction Performance (examples)
- **Stiction Reduction**: Example reports cite reductions around 98% (simulations and limited prototypes). See `docs/benchmarks.md` for experiment context, raw data, and uncertainty treatment.
- **Casimir Force Enhancement**: Some modeling results show large enhancement factors (orders-of-magnitude increases in modeled force under specific metamaterial parameters). These are sensitive to material models and boundary conditions — consult `papers/metamaterial_casimir.tex` and UQ notes before interpreting absolute magnitudes.
- **Contact Angle Control**: Contact angles reported in prototypes are typically in the 130°–145° range depending on surface treatment; values depend on measurement method and environment.
- **Work of Adhesion**: Reported example values are below 10 mJ/m² in select experiments; treat as conditional on SAM composition and surface preparation.
- **Operational Range**: Designed for experiments in the ~1–100 nm gap regime; maintaining gaps at the low end requires controlled environments and independent verification.

### Digital Twin & Measurement Precision (examples)
- **Force Measurement**: Reported instrumentation precisions (example: sub-pm level in controlled setups) should be interpreted in the context of the reported measurement setup and calibration procedures.
- **Thermal Stability & Uncertainty**: Thermal drift and environmental variability are important contributors to uncertainty; reproduction details and time-series data are provided under `docs/` when available.
- **Force Prediction & Coverage**: Model prediction accuracy is reported in limited test cases; full uncertainty propagation (sensitivity analysis, CI-like bounds) is documented in `docs/UQ-notes.md` where available.

## 🛠️ Anti-Stiction Technologies

### 1. Self-Assembled Monolayers (SAMs)

**Implementation Path (examples)**
- Anti-stiction coatings using adhesion layers (e.g., Ti/Cr) and SAM chemistry. Reported work-of-adhesion targets are conditional on surface chemistry and processing; see `docs/benchmarks.md` for specific recipes and reproducibility notes.

### 2. Metamaterial Spacer Arrays

**Design Strategy (notes)**:
- Hyperbolic metamaterials and related designs are explored for enhancement of Casimir-type interactions. Reported enhancement ranges in literature and simulations vary widely; model assumptions and material loss terms strongly affect outcomes. See `papers/metamaterial_casimir.tex` and accompanying UQ notes.

### 3. Repulsive Force Engineering

**Physical Mechanism (summary)**:
- Under specific metamaterial and boundary conditions, Casimir-Lifshitz interactions can be engineered to produce reduced attractive forces or repulsive contributions in modeled systems. Practical demonstration depends on material synthesis, losses, and precise geometry. Claims of real-time stiction prevention are experimental goals and require end-to-end validation.

## 📊 Performance Targets (interpretation guidance)

### Anti-Stiction Specifications (interpret carefully)
| Parameter | Example target or reported value | Notes |
|-----------|----------------------------------:|-------|
| Static pull-in gap | ≥5 nm (design target in some studies) | Achieving low-nm thresholds depends on experimental conditions and independent V&V.
| Work of adhesion | ≤10 mJ/m² (reported in select tests) | Dependent on SAM formulation and surface prep; check raw artifacts.
| Repulsive force | >1 nN at 5 nm (model example) | Example-model results; sensitive to material loss and geometry.
| Surface quality | ≤0.2 nm RMS (fabrication target) | Achievable in specialized facilities; yield and reproducibility vary by process.
| Manufacturing yield | >90% (aspirational) | Reported yields should be confirmed with larger-scale tests and QA data.

### Technology Readiness (summary)
- Mathematical models and fabrication approaches are documented in `papers/` and `docs/` but are research-stage and require further independent validation. Status indicators in this README are not a substitute for formal V&V, peer review, or regulatory/compliance checks required for operational use.

## 🤖 Digital Twin Framework

### **Real-Time Mathematical Framework**

**Comprehensive Implementation**: [`src/prototype/digital_twin_framework.py`](src/prototype/digital_twin_framework.py)

The digital twin provides real-time monitoring, control, and optimization with uncertainty quantification:

#### **1. State Space Representation**
```
x(k+1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k) + w(k)
y(k) = Cx(k) + v(k)
```

State vector: `x = [d(t), ḋ(t), F_Casimir(t), θ_SAM(t), T_surface(t)]ᵀ`

#### **2. UQ-Enhanced Force Model**
```
F_total = F_Casimir × (1 + ε_UQ) + F_adhesion × (1 + δ_material)
σ_F² = (∂F/∂ε')²σ_ε'² + (∂F/∂μ')²σ_μ'² + (∂F/∂d)²σ_d²
```

#### **3. Digital Twin Fidelity Metric**
```
Φ_fidelity = exp(-1/2 Σᵢ [(x_measured,i - x_twin,i)ᵀ Σ⁻¹ (x_measured,i - x_twin,i)])
```

#### **4. Adaptive Kalman Filter**
```
x̂(k|k) = x̂(k|k-1) + K_k(y_k - Cx̂(k|k-1))
K_k = P(k|k-1)Cᵀ(CP(k|k-1)Cᵀ + R)⁻¹
```

#### **5. Predictive Control with UQ Bounds**
```
u* = arg min Σᵢ [‖xᵢ₊₁ - x_ref‖²_Q + ‖uᵢ‖²_R]
P(d_min ≤ d(t) ≤ d_max) ≥ 0.95 ∀t ∈ [0,T]
```

- **Material Uncertainty**: reported <4.1% in selected analyses; depends on measurement and model assumptions
- **Fidelity Score**: reported ≥95% for specific digital-twin configurations; treat as case-specific until independently reproduced

### **Real-Time Capabilities**

- **Control Computation**: <10 μs per cycle
- **Parameter Identification**: <1 ms convergence
- **Model Reduction**: 99% energy capture with 3× compression

### **Integration Features**
